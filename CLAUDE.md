## Developer Thoughts

These are thoughts captured while working on this codebase (via [yap](https://github.com/selviarora/yap)):

- add tests for the store module [todo] _(Jan 31)_
- what if yap had a TUI mode for browsing thoughts _(Jan 31)_
- need to handle the ? glob issue better - maybe use 'here' as alias _(Jan 31)_
- context.ts - should we also capture the current file being edited? _(Jan 31)_
- the store.ts could use an in-memory cache for faster reads _(Jan 31)_
- should we add readline for interactive capture? _(Jan 31)_
- this is the new yap, feels cleaner _(Jan 31)_
